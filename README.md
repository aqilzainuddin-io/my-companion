This is a simplified, public version of my personal AI companion project — built to explore the idea of emotionally expressive virtual assistants. It's a passion project, blending tech with intimacy, interaction, and imagination. 💖

## 🌟 Features

- 🌐 Basic project structure for a virtual companion
- 🧠 Prepped for integration with AI and avatar interfaces
- 🔧 Ready for expansion into voice, animation, or desktop/web assistant forms
- 📦 Clean Node.js starter (if applicable)
